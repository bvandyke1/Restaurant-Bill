# Restaurant-Bill

The purpose of this project was to calculate an entire restaurant bill, and demonstrate competence with C++ output, as well as some basic arithmetic functions. The subtotal of the bill is assigned to the "MealCharge" variable, and the rest of the bill is calculated from that. The results are printed into the output, and the program requires no input.
